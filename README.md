# Common Packages 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicholasnet/common.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/nicholasnet/common)

Common utility that can be used in any PHP applications using any framework. This library consists packages that are used in frameworks like
 * Laravel
 * YII 2
 * Symfony 2
 
 We simply copied those awesome packages and put in this package so that we can use it in any PHP application without bringing down any framework baggage.
 
 There is only one external dependency to run this package which provides `random_bytes` method in PHP version less than 7.
